# Data protocol

The data protocol transmits messages from `publishers` to `subscribers` via a `proxy server` in a broadcasting fashion.

## Transport layer

The transport layer ensures that a message arrives at its destination.

### Socket configuration

A `proxy server` is the transmitting station, it shall offer an XSUBSCRIBER and an XPUBLISHER socket.
The two sockets shall be connected, e.g. via the `zmq.proxy_server` method.
Each of both sockets shall be bound to its own address.

A `Publisher` is a Component, which sends data messages via the data protocol.
It shall have a PUBLISHER socket connecting to the proxy server's XSUBSCRIBER socket.

A `Subscriber` is a Component, which wants to reveice data messages via the data protocol.
It shall have a SUBSCRIBER socket connecting to the proxy server's XPUBLISHER socket.
It should subscribe to the {ref}`Topics <data_protocol.md#topic>` it wants to receive.

:::{note}
Subscribing to a topic in zmq means to subscribe to all topics which **start** with the given topic name!

#### Recommended configuration

It is recommended to have a single program with two proxy servers.
The first one transfers any data and binds its XSUBSCRIBER to port number 11100 and binds its XPUBLISHER to 11099.
The second one transfers log entries and binds to 11098 and 11097, respectively.


## Message format

A Data Protocol Message consists in three or more frames ([#62](https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol/issues/62)):
1. {ref}`data_protocol.md#topic`
2. {ref}`data_protocol.md#header`
3. One or more data frames, the first one is the {ref}`data_protocol.md#content`

### Topic

The topic is the full name of the sending Component. ([#60](https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol/issues/60))

### Header

Similar to the {ref}`control protocol header <control_protocol.md#message-composition>`, the header consists in
1. UUIDv7
2. a one byte `message_type` (`0` not defined, `1` JSON, `>127` user defined)

### Content

#### Log message content

For log messages, the content is a JSON encoded list of:
- `record.asctime`: Timestamp formatted as `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`
- `record.levelname`: Logger level name
- `record.name`: Logger name
- `record.text` (including traceback)
